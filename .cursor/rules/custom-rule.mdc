# Rules

<!-- - Use OpenAI Response API instead of completion api, here is the doc: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses -->
- use shadcn when needed, use command to install like: npx shadcn@latest add card
- interface Text use Enlish.
- Use Proxy Setting if network doesn't work: export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 all_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:7890
- Use pnpm to install
- Use ai sdk to deal LLM, https://ai-sdk.dev/docs
- Do not run pnpm run dev since i've run it.
- Check components/ui before npx a new shadcn components.
- use import { openai } from "@/lib/ai-sdk-client" instead of import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai", cuz of the proxy issue.
