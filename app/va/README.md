# Values Affirmation (VA) Chat Module

An open-source, plug-and-play Values Affirmation intervention module inspired by Geoffrey Cohen's research. This module helps chatbot developers integrate a proven psychological intervention to reduce stereotype threat, boost self-integrity, and improve user engagement—especially in high-stakes or identity-relevant contexts.

## Features

- **Adaptable VA Framework**: Users reflect on core values through guided prompts with dynamic responses that affirm user identity
- **Plug-and-Play Design**: Compatible with major chatbot platforms with modular code for easy integration
- **Customizable & Culturally Aware**: Adjustable prompts for different contexts with anonymization options
- **Open-Source & Research-Backed**: Links to Cohen's studies on VA efficacy with community-driven improvements

## Implementation

The VA module consists of three main components:

1. **Value Prompt**: Asks users to select or provide a core value that's important to them
2. **Reflection Prompt**: Encourages users to reflect on why the value is important to them
3. **Affirmation Response**: Provides affirming feedback based on the user's shared value and reflection

## Research Background

The Values Affirmation intervention is based on the work of social psychologist Geoffrey Cohen and colleagues. Their research has shown that brief self-affirmation exercises can reduce the effects of stereotype threat and improve outcomes in various domains including education and healthcare.
