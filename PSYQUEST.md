    consentStatus: ConsentRecord;
    participationHistory: SessionHistory[];
  };
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface PsychProfile {
  personalityTraits: PersonalityMetrics;
  cognitiveStyle: CognitiveAssessment;
  aiAttitudes: AIAttitudeScale;
  baselineMetrics: BaselineAssessment;
}
```

### Interaction Models
```typescript
interface InteractionSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  sessionType: 'conversation' | 'task' | 'assessment';
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  interactions: InteractionEvent[];
  metrics: SessionMetrics;
  aiModel: AIModelConfig;
}

interface InteractionEvent {
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'user_message' | 'ai_response' | 'user_action' | 'system_event';
  content: string;
  metadata: EventMetadata;
  emotionalState?: EmotionalMetrics;
}
```
